# [The Elements of Data Science](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=26598)
In this course, we'll explore the machine learning process from end-to-end. It's important to know how data influences and impacts this process, because your machine learning solution is only as good as the data that drives it.

# What is Data Science?
In this section we'll discuss managing, analyzing, and visualizing data. Machine learning models are only useful when you have high-quality data, which can be curated using the data science workflow.
